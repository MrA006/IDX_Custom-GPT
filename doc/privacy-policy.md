# Privacy Policy for CompAnalyzer GPT

_Last updated: August 3, 2025_

CompAnalyzer GPT is a custom AI assistant that fetches real estate comparables (comps) using your filters and presents the data in a summarized format. This assistant is powered by OpenAI's GPT and interacts with a backend service connected to the Spark IDX Replication API.

## Data Collection

CompAnalyzer GPT may collect the following user-provided information through prompts or API calls:
- Filter parameters such as number of beds, baths, square footage, price range, and location.
- Request history within the conversation.

## Data Usage

The assistant uses the above data solely to:
- Call the backend service to fetch relevant real estate comps
- Format and display data such as ARV, price per square foot, and CSV exports

We do **not** store, resell, or share your data with any third party outside of:
- OpenAI (for prompt processing)
- Spark API (to retrieve public MLS data)

## Third-Party Services

This GPT integrates with:
